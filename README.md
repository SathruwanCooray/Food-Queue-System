# Food Queue System

This is a simple Food Queue System designed to manage customer queues efficiently. The system offers two versions: an array-based version and a class-based version. This project was done as 1st year, second semester programming coursework at IIT institution affiliate with University of Westminster.

3. **Add customer to a queue (ACQ - 102):** Add a customer to the queue of choice. Users can select which queue they wish to join.
4. **Remove a customer from a queue (RCQ - 103):** Remove a customer from a specific queue.
5. **Remove a served customer (PCQ - 104):** Remove the first customer from the queue as they are served.
6. **View Customers Sorted in alphabetical order (VCS - 105):** Display customers in queues sorted alphabetically.
7. **Store program data into file (SPD - 106):** Save the program data to a file for future use.
8. **Load program data from file (LDP - 107):** Load previously stored program data from a file.
9. **View remaining burgers Stock (STK - 108):** Display the remaining stock of burgers.
10. **Add burgers to stock (AFS - 109):** Increase the stock of burgers.
11. **Exit the program (EXT - 999):** Close the program.

### Class Version

**Class version the customer automatically will be added to the first position of the 1st queue and move up accordinly**

1. **View all queues (VFQ - 100):** Display all queues along with their current status.
2. **View all empty queues (VEQ - 101):** Display queues that are currently empty.
3. **Add customer to a queue (ACQ - 102):** Add a customer to the queue. Customers are automatically added to the appropriate queue based on availability.
4. **Remove a customer from a queue (RCQ - 103):** Remove a customer from a specific queue.
5. **Remove a served customer (PCQ - 104):** Remove the first customer from the queue as they are served.
6. **View Customers Sorted in alphabetical order (VCS - 105):** Display customers in queues sorted alphabetically.
7. **Store program data into file (SPD - 106):** Save the program data to a file for future use.

9. **View remaining burgers Stock (STK - 108):** Display the remaining stock of burgers.
10. **Add burgers to stock (AFS - 109):** Increase the stock of burgers.
11. **Calculate the income (IFQ - 110):** Calculate the total income generated by the system.
12. **Open the GUI (GUI - 112):** Launch the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Food Queue System.
